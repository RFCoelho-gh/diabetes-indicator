## About DiaBot
The DiaBot model is designed to identify patients with diabetes and those at risk of developing it. This initial model was trained on data from 230,000 patients, learning from various health indicators and lifestyle factors to improve early detection and intervention.

## Topic and Goals
The primary goal of DiaBot is to support medical staff in identifying:
- Existing diabetes cases in patients.
- Patients who are at a heightened risk of developing diabetes in the future.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 230,000 patient records, each containing 22 attributes. These include lifestyle factors, drug consumption, and key health indicators. Data preparation steps included:
- Removing ambiguous data entries.
- Scaling of numerical features for improved model performance.

## Feature Engineering
The DiaBot model incorporates several advanced feature engineering techniques:
- **Undersampling**: Balancing the dataset for equal representation across groups.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Exhaustive tuning to improve accuracy.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluated multiple models, including:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Bagging Ensemble

## Model Performance
### Confusion Matrix
| Metric | True Negative | False Positive | False Negative | True Positive |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Cases  | 30,000       | 12,657        | 1,512         | 5,542        |

### Statistics
- **Overall Accuracy**: 72%
- **Recall (Positive Cases)**: 79%
- **Precision (Positive Cases)**: 31%
- **Recall (Negative Cases)**: 70%
- **Precision (Negative Cases)**: 95%

The modelâ€™s high recall for positive cases ensures it captures most true diabetes cases, while high precision for negative cases minimizes false positives.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
The DiaBot model shows strong potential for aiding healthcare providers in diabetes detection. With additional development, it can further reduce false positives, enhancing its role in preventive healthcare.
